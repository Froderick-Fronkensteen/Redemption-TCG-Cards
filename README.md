These are all the card files available for Redemption TCG from the Land of Redemption [website](http://landofredemption.com).  I wanted to make it easier to pull all the cards at once instead of having to grab each one manually.

I do not own any of these images or card lists.  All card images are owned by [Cactus Game Design INC](https://www.cactusgamedesign.com).  All the card list were originally published by the Land of Redemption website.

If you are looking for the latest rules and REG please see the links before.  You will be redirected to Cactus Game Design INC website.
